It is pressed at temperatures below 50 degrees celsius and contains an acid content of 0.2%, far below the 1% required for the extra virgin designation. In addition, no heat or solvents are ever used to extract the oil from the fruit. Due to its high chlorophyll content, avocado oil is very unstable and can degrade very quickly, so after extraction Olivado subjects the oil to a unique and natural process that completely stabilises it, retaining the goodness for up to 2 years in an unopened bottle. The oil has the rich, buttery, delicate taste profile of ripe avocados. In turning the avocado into oil, Olivado has maintained all the health properties of this most nutritious wonder fruit, in a delicious, versatile, shelf stable oil that can be used as an alternative to olive oil in any recipe. Unlike some strong olive oils, Olivado Extra Virgin Avocado oil is never bitter, will not burn at moderate temperatures and won't overpower your recipes. It has excellent health benefits, including monounsaturated fat (the good fat), has no cholesterol, no carbohydrates, and can be used as an essential component of the new Mediterranean Diet. Contains the oil of 20 avocados, kosher, no trans fats, all natural, high in mono-unsaturates, nutrients and antioxidants.

This makes it the perfect sugar alternative for diabetics, low carb “keto” dieters and anyone reducing calories. At 70% the sweetness of sugar, it has nearly all the taste but none of the guilt.

You can replace your sugar in all of your cooking without spoiling the recipes. Unlike most sugar alternatives, there is no bitter or unpleasant aftertaste just a sweet and refreshing taste some describe as a mild cooling sensation. Erythritol poses no risk of tooth decay, and dentists love it. Research suggests oral bacteria cannot feed off of Erythritol in the mouth and therefore prevents build-up of oral plague.

Such as in ice creams, meringues and beverages! As part of the “sugar alcohol” family, Erythritol is a naturally derived extract from fruits and plants and passes straight through your body undigested. Therefore, erythritol does not affect blood glucose levels in most people and has zero net carbohydrates! This makes it the perfect sugar alternative for diabetics, low carb “keto” dieters and anyone reducing calories. At 70% the sweetness of sugar, it has nearly all the taste but none of the guilt. By comparison, sugar has a Glycemic Index (GI) of 68 and Erythritol has a GI of 0 which is why there are no blood sugar increases and no storage of fat! You can replace your sugar in all of your cooking without spoiling the recipes. Unlike most sugar alternatives, there is no bitter or unpleasant aftertaste just a sweet and refreshing taste some describe as a mild cooling sensation. Erythritol poses no risk of tooth decay, and dentists love it. Research suggests oral bacteria cannot feed off of Erythritol in the mouth and therefore prevents build-up of oral plague. And if your furry friends like to hoover up the crumbs, there’s no need to worry as Erythritol is completely safe for pets!Benefits of erythritol? Zero caloriesZero GIZero active carbohydratesDiabetic friendly No aspartameNo tooth decay Stomach friendly Perfect for ketone diets""",https://www.planetorganic.com/products/nkd-living-powdered-erythritol-1kg,
